## Welcome!

Please introduce yourself, and share what drew you to this discussion session.

Notes:
Introductions in the full group.

---

## Why does it matter how researchers learn?

Notes:
Overview here, a la abstract.

## Format for today

- Discussion prompts
- Breakout rooms
- Return to full group
- Repeat!

Notes:
Our role is to synthesize, identify emerging themes and potential conflicts to resolve, etc. We're not going to be driving the discussion; rather, we're eager to hear what you all have to say, and want to let that shape the direction of our discussion!

---

What kinds of learning do researchers engage in?

What motivates them to spend time on learning?

---

How do we measure other kinds of learners?

What constructs do we assess?

Which of these apply to a researcher population, and which might not?

---

Think of papers you've read that included data about researchers. What did they measure?

---

How might a researcher's motivation and constraints as learner differ based on...

- career stage
- institutional affiliation or country
- job description (what other than research do they do?)
- area of research specialty
- demographic considerations (family status, disability, membership in an underrepresented or marginalized group, income, preferred language(s), etc.)
- ?

Notes:
Researchers are a heterogenous group, with diverse interests, needs, challenges, and constraints.
