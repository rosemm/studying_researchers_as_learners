## Why does it matter how researchers learn?

Notes:
Because open science and reproducibility represent a recent paradigm shift, the associated behaviors differ from what many researchers were taught during their formal training. As a result, the spread of open science practices necessarily relies upon researchers engaging in continued education. Many researchers have already taken it upon themselves to self-educate on these important topics, and as incentives shift slowly to place more value on reproducible methods, more will continue to do so. Despite this, our understanding of researchers as students is decidedly limited. Of the few studies that exist characterizing researchers and scientists in their capacity as learners, most focus exclusively on those still in graduate school or med school. Widespread culture change in the sciences will require researchers at every career level --- not just students --- to dedicate precious time to studying new methods and tools. Understanding the needs, values, constraints, and motivations of this unique body of learners will be critical to designing successful educational interventions for them.
We propose a discussion session around measurement of constructs relevant to researchers as learners. Which factors impact motivation to continue study? Which characteristics can be used to build productive communities of practice, helping to sustain long term commitment? What do we need to know about a researcher to match them to appropriate and effective educational content to move them on their path toward open science?

## Format for today

- Discussion prompts
- Breakout rooms
- Return to full group
- Repeat!

Notes:
Our role is to synthesize, identify emerging themes and potential conflicts to resolve, etc. We're not going to be driving the discussion; rather, we're eager to hear what you all have to say, and want to let that shape the direction of our discussion!

---

What kinds of learning do researchers engage in?

What motivates them to spend time on learning?

---

How do we measure other kinds of learners?

What constructs do we assess?

Which of these apply to a researcher population, and which might not?

---

Think of papers you've read that included data about researchers. What did they measure?

---

How might a researcher's motivation and constraints as learner differ based on...

- career stage
- institutional affiliation or country
- job description (what other than research do they do?)
- area of research specialty
- demographic considerations (family status, disability, membership in an underrepresented or marginalized group, income, preferred language(s), etc.)
- ?

Notes:
Researchers are a heterogenous group, with diverse interests, needs, challenges, and constraints.
